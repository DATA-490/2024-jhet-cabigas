# Type of project
A web application that processes, visualizes and compares scraped League of Legends character stats.

# Purpose (including intended audience)
The idea behind Delta is to create an easy way for users to view the changes in the strength of League of Legends characters over time. Once the user chooses a period to view, this can be done in three ways: Line graphs showing the change in a specific character's stats, an automatically generated changelist for a specific character's abilities, and a table showing the change in every character's stats. These features can be useful for players at every level of the game, from beginners who want to see what is strong, to veterans who need to quickly catch up, to pros and analysts that want to stay ahead of the curve.
